KnowHows is a Slack application that tracks your GitHub repositories and allows users to search for other developers who have knowledge about certain parts of code, such as an API or software concept. By invoking the /knowhows command in an installed Slack channel, users can query KnowHows on code terms or general software concepts parsed from repository commits. KnowHows then produces a ranked list of tracked users in your channel that are likely to have the most experience with that query. Currently, KnowHows tracks Java (.java), C (.c), C++ (.cpp), and C# (.cs) source code commits.

The available commands are:

• /knowhows to [query] - Performs a natural language search on a concept, such as "write to a file". This produces a ranked list of tracked users indicating files that they have changed.
• /knowhows search [query] - Performs a literal search on a code term, such as an API name like "FileWriter". This produces a ranked list of tracked users indicating files that they have changed.
• /knowhows track [repository_name | *] - Tracks and indexes one or all (*) of your repositories. When no repository is specified, a list of your untracked repositories is returned.
/knowhows untrack [repository_name | *] - Untracks and unindexes one or all (*) of your repositories. When no repository is specified, a list of your currently tracked repositories is returned.
• /knowhows help - Prints a brief description of each of these commands.

When first invoking /knowhows from a channel with the app installed, KnowHows will prompt you for access to your GitHub account. When you have successfully authenticated, KnowHows will automatically track all of your public GitHub repositories. Repositories tracked by you only retrieve your authored commits and are only available to users in your installed channel.
